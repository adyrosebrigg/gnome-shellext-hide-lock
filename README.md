 GNOME Shell Extension to hide the Screen Lock menuitem

I simply never use the "Lock" item in the System Menu (except by accident), so after a quick search for an extension like this came up empty, I decided to make one. Tested solely on GNOME 42/Ubuntu 22.04 because this is just a quick personal fixup, but I'll put it on the extensions site in case anyone else wants to try it on their system.

Roadmap: Instead of hiding the item, move it into the "Power Off/Log Out" submenu for users who still want access to it. I tried messing with this but couldn't figure out how to deregister the item from its current position and didn't feel like digging too deep as my JS chops are way rusty and GNOME's documentation of the JS api kinda blows. Feel free to fork/pr if you know how to do this.
